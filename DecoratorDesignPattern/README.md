-> Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
-> "Wrapper" is the alternative nickname of the Decorator pattern that clearly expresses the main idea of the pattern. A wrapper is an object that can be linked with some target object.
APPLICABILITY
-> Use the decorator pattern when the need of assign extra behavior to objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects.
-> Use the pattern when it's awkward or not possible to extend an object's behavior using inheritance.
